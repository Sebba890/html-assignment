<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> Hello Guys! My name is Sebastian Romero and I am a first year IMD (Interactive Media Design) student at Algonquin College. I do photography on the side as a hobby and what I mostly shoot is street photography. My goal for this class is to perfect a photography page where I could display my pictures or my art work as I like to say. I speak three languages: Spanish, English and French. </p>
