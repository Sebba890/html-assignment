<article> <h2> About Me </h2> </article>
<p> Hello Guys! My name is Sebastian Romero and I am a first year IMD (Interactive Media Design) student at Algonquin College. I do photography on the side as a hobby and what I mostly shoot is street photography. My goal for this class is to perfect a photography page where I could display my pictures or my art work as I like to say. I speak three languages: <em>Spanish, English and French.</em> </p>
<p> I was born in Colombia and for that reason I am not a fan of the cold if I will be completely honest with you guys. I enjoy watching sports, spending time with my family and going out on adventures. I consider myself outgoing,friendly and someone that loves making new friends. I am the 1<sup>st</sup> child out of 4 children.</p>
